As we know, a Large number of people from all over the world come to Delhi for different kinds of purposes such as study, career, business, etc. and each newcomer wants to stay area/neighborhood which is similar to their previous one or in which they can live a comfortable life. Finding the best place for living is very difficult in a place like Delhi because of such a large population and variety. Through this project, I will explore this beautiful city so that the newcomers can decide which area/neighborhood they would want to stay in or figure out the best places to eat/shop. Below shown the files associated with this project and their purpose: -
